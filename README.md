# Minesweeper Image / Gif Creator

This tool is able to create an image or gifs of Minesweeper Games played.  
For this tool I created a custom data storage format for Minesweeper Games since there was no existing standard that included everything I wanted.  
If you are interested in the data format you can read more about it here: https://monograph.notesnook.com/63fe1bae090909be7a7e7e80

By default, the Programm will ask you for a GameID. These GameIDs are based on the games player on my Network: greev.eu.  
But if you want its also possible to insert the raw data by just using the command line flag `-c`, it will then ask you for the raw data instead of the GameID.


*Notice: Textures are based on the original Faithful textures from Vattic: https://web.archive.org/web/20150607220656/http://www.minecraftforum.net:80/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1223254-faithful-32x32-pack-update-red-cat-clay-1-8*
